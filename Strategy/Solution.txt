Strategy - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

- Design Principle #1: "Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same"
- Design Principle #2: "Program to an interface, not an implementation"
- Design Principle #3: "Favor composition over inheritance" ( HAS-A is better than IS-A)
