Observer - defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state,
all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically

- Design Principle #4: "Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact" (minimize interdependency between objects)
- You can push or pull data from the Observable when using the pattern (pull is considered more "correct")
- Don't depend on a specific order of notification for your observers.
