Singleton - ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.
The biggest challenge for singleton objects is that they need to be thread safe. This can be achieved in multiple ways.

- using lock (simple thread-safety) => Performance impact
- double-check locking => Reduced performance impact
- lazy instantiation => compiler marks as beforefieldinit
- fully lazy instatiation => compiler does not mark as beforefieldinit
