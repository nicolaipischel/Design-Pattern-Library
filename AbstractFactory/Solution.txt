Abstract Factory - provides an interface for creating families of related or dependet objects without specifying their concrete classes

- Each method in that interface is responsible for creating a concrete product, and we implement a subclass of the abstract factory
  to supply those implementations. Therefore often the methods of an abstract factory are implemented as factory methods.

- It encapsulates object creation and leads to a more decoupled, flexible design

- Relies on object composition for creating objects. Object creation is implemented in methods exposed in the factory interface.
