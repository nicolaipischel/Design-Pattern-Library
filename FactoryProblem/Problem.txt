The problem with this approach is that it has some disadvantages:

- We have to modify internal code each time a new pizza type gets added or removed to/from the store 
  since this is a vital part of our application this logic may be duplicated a lot of times over the overall application code.
  Resulting in a bunch of locations that need to change each time a new pizza type gets added.

- We mix code that stays the same with code that varies over time. 
  ex. The code for the preperation of the pizza will mostly stay the same while the types may vary.
