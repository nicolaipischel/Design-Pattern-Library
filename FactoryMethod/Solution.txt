Factory - defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
Factory methods lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

- the factory method returns a product that is typically used withing methods defined in the super class.

- It encapsulates object creation and leads to a more decoupled, flexible design

- It encapsulates product knowledge into each creator. This is a class that contains the implementations
  for all of the methods to manipulate the product except the factory method. (aka. internal)

- The concrete creator implement the factory methods which is the method that actually produces the product.

- Relies on inheritance for creation objects. Object creation is delegated to subclasses, which implement the factory method
  to create objects.
